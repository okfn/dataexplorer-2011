**DEPRECATION NOTICE:** Data Explorer has been merged into (and replaced by) `Recline`_ - please see that repo for more details.

.. _Recline: http://github.com/okfn/recline

----

DataExplorer_ is a pure javascript opensource client-side web application for
viewing and visualizing data.

It's similar to applications like ManyEyes or the Google Visualization Tools
(such as the public data explorer) but is:

  * Open-source
  * Pure javascript (not Flash)
  * Pure client-side app -- so it's easy to embed in other sites and
    applications
  * Designed to integrate and reuse existing (open-source) libraries
